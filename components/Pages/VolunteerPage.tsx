              I volunteered with Ni√±asPro, an initiative dedicated to empowering
              young girls aged 14-20 to pursue STEAM careers. During my time
              there, I took on the role of a mentor for their annual course and
              also coordinated calls and follow-ups for participants. I am
              currently a member of a corporation.
